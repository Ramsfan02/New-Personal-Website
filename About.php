   <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I am 17 years old and a Junior at Clovis East High School, as well as a student at the Center For Advanced Research and Technology and a 3rd year AFJROTC cadet </p>
    
    <h2>Plans after high school</h2>
    <p>What I plan to do after high school is I plan to go to a game designing college such as, Full Sail University or Southern New Hampshire University and major in game design and hopefully after I will be working for EA or 2K. If my first plan does not go as planned I have other choices;My second choice is to go to the Universal Technical Institute and then work for NHRA(national hot rod association) and my final choice would be to go into the military and join the Air Force and be a RPA pilot(remotely piloted aircraft).</p>
